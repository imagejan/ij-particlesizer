# ij-particlesizer

ImageJ script to derive number based size distributions based on recorded TEM images. A focus of the development was to provide different splitting methods to handle agglomerates and aggregates, robust handling of different noise levels and adaptability to non-standard images. The script combines several imagej plugins to one user friendly application.
