# ij-particlesizer

ImageJ plugin to derive number based size distributions based on recorded TEM images. A focus of the development was to provide different splitting methods to handle agglomerates and aggregates, robust handling of different noise levels and adaptability to non-standard images.

Unfortunately the consortium agreement do not allow to publish the plugin now. This is placeholder! The plugin will published here as soon as the project finished or the consortium allow it.
